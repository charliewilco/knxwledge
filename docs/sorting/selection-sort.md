Goal
- Sort by selecting the minimum element each pass.

Files

- Tests: `src/sorting/selection-sort.test.ts`

Complexity
- O(n^2) time, O(1) extra space

Edge cases
- Empty array returns empty array

Example
- [4, 2, 1] -> [1, 2, 4].

Notes
- See the tests for expected behavior and additional scenarios.
