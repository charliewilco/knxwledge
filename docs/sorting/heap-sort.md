# Heap Sort

Goal
- Sort by heapifying and extracting max elements.

Files
- Implementation: `src/sorting/heap-sort.ts`
- Tests: `src/sorting/heap-sort.test.ts`

Complexity
- O(n log n) time, O(1) extra space

Edge cases
- Not stable (equal elements may reorder)

Example
- [4, 10, 3] -> [3, 4, 10].

Notes
- See the tests for expected behavior and additional scenarios.
