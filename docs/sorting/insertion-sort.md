Goal
- Sort by inserting elements into a growing sorted prefix.

Files
- Implementation: `src/sorting/insertion-sort.ts`
- Tests: `src/sorting/insertion-sort.test.ts`

Complexity
- O(n^2) worst-case, O(n) best-case
- O(1) extra space

Edge cases
- Single-element array

Example
- [3, 1, 2] -> [1, 2, 3].

Notes
- See the tests for expected behavior and additional scenarios.
