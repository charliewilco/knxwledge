# Merge Sort

Goal
- Sort via divide-and-conquer merging of sorted halves.

Files
- Implementation: `src/sorting/merge-sort.ts`
- Tests: `src/sorting/merge-sort.test.ts`

Complexity
- O(n log n) time, O(n) space

Edge cases
- Stable sort (equal elements keep order)

Example
- [5, 2, 4, 1] -> [1, 2, 4, 5].

Notes
- See the tests for expected behavior and additional scenarios.
