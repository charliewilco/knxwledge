# Bubble Sort

Goal
- Sort by repeated adjacent swaps.

Files
- Implementation: `src/sorting/bubble-sort.ts`
- Tests: `src/sorting/bubble-sort.test.ts`

Complexity
- O(n^2) time, O(1) extra space

Edge cases
- Already-sorted array

Example
- [3, 1, 2] -> [1, 2, 3].

Notes
- See the tests for expected behavior and additional scenarios.
