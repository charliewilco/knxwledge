# Max Path Sum

Goal
- Compute the maximum path sum in a binary tree.

Files
- Implementation: `src/problems/max-path-sum.ts`
- Tests: `src/problems/max-path-sum.test.ts`

Complexity
- O(n) time, O(h) recursion stack

Edge cases
- All-negative trees still return the max (least negative) node

Example
- Tree 1-2-3 -> max path sum 6.

Notes
- See the tests for expected behavior and additional scenarios.
