# Longest Increasing Sequence

Goal
- Find the longest contiguous increasing run in an array.

Files
- Implementation: `src/problems/longest-sequence.ts`
- Tests: `src/problems/longest-sequence.test.ts`

Complexity
- O(n) time, O(n) space for result

Edge cases
- Returns [] when no run longer than 1 exists

Example
- [1,2,3,2,3,4] -> [2,3,4].

Notes
- See the tests for expected behavior and additional scenarios.
