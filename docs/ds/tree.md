# Binary Tree

Goal
- Implement a basic binary tree with insert/contains helpers.

Files
- Implementation: `src/ds/tree.ts`
- Tests: `src/ds/tree.test.ts`

Complexity
- insert/contains: O(h) where h is tree height

Edge cases
- Skewed tree degrades to O(n) height

Example
- Insert 5, 3, 7 -> contains(3) === true.

Notes
- See the tests for expected behavior and additional scenarios.
