# Binary Search Tree

Goal
- Implement BST operations and traversal helpers.

Files
- Implementation: `src/ds/binary-search-tree.ts`
- Tests: `src/ds/binary-search-tree.test.ts`

Complexity
- insert/contains/min/max: O(h)
- traversals: O(n)

Edge cases
- Duplicates are ignored by insert logic

Example
- Insert 5, 3, 7 -> min()=3, max()=7, in-order=[3,5,7].

Notes
- See the tests for expected behavior and additional scenarios.
