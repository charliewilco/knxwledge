# Linked List

Goal
- Implement a singly linked list with basic operations.

Files
- Implementation: `src/ds/linked-list.ts`
- Tests: `src/ds/linked-list.test.ts`

Complexity
- size: O(n)
- addToTail: O(n)
- getByIndex: O(n)

Edge cases
- Empty list
- Index out of bounds throws

Example
- List with [1, 2] -> size() === 2; getByIndex(1).payload === 2.

Notes
- See the tests for expected behavior and additional scenarios.
