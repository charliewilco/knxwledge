# Grokking Algorithms: Binary Search

Goal
- Implement binary search from the book example.

Files
- Implementation: `src/workbooks/bhargava/binary-search.ts`

Complexity
- O(log n) time, O(1) space

Edge cases
- Returns -1 when target is missing

Example
- [1,3,5,7], target 3 -> index 1.

Notes
- See the tests for expected behavior and additional scenarios.
