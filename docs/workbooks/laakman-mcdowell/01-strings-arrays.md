# Cracking the Coding Interview: Strings and Arrays

Goal
- Practice string/array interview questions from the workbook.

Files
- Implementation: `src/workbooks/laakman-mcdowell/01-strings-arrays.ts`
- Tests: `src/workbooks/laakman-mcdowell/01-strings-arrays.test.ts`

Complexity
- Varies by exercise; see function comments

Edge cases
- Some exercises are placeholders (oneAway)

Example
- isUnique("abc") -> true; isPermutation("abc","bca") -> true.

Notes
- See the tests for expected behavior and additional scenarios.
