# Binary Search

Goal
- Binary search over a sorted list.

Files
- Implementation: `src/searching/binary-search.ts`
- Tests: `src/searching/binary-search.test.ts`

Complexity
- O(log n) time, O(1) space

Edge cases
- Throws if list is empty or unsorted

Example
- [1, 3, 5, 7], target 5 -> index 2.

Notes
- See the tests for expected behavior and additional scenarios.
